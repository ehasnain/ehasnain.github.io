## About me

<span class="image right"><a class="image fit"><img src="/images/me/image002.jpg" style= "width:auto; height:220px" alt="" /></a></span>

I'm Ehtesham Hasnain. I am a civil engineer, surveyor, geo-engineer and a developer. I am a student at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

I am very obsessed with programming, and I like learning new technologies. I love to explore the wonders and the possibilities of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in solving real world problems. You can find some of my works on [GitHub](https://github.com/ehasnain).

I like [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ehteshamhasnain) and hiking. My leisure activities include cycling and book-reading too. I am an open supporter of sustainable development.
